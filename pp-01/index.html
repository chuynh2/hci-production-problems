  	The two typefaces that I am pairing are Source Sans Pro and Source Code Pro. The strategy that I am using is
  	rely on family. Source Sans Pro is Adobe's first open source typeface family and it is a sans serif typeface.
  	Source Code Pro was design to be part of the Source Sans Pro family, but is more used in coding enviroments.
