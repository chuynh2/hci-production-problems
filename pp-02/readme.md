## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=14H0u0kqqfP90++tHNrnu2e++00
Your Rationale: I choose this color palette filled with purple and black to introduce a new console gaming platform because the color meaning behind purple and black is creativity/wealth and elegance. A new console means that it will most likely to be expensive, and to attract people to use the console it has to be elegant too. The console could be use as a creative media to be expressed through different games. 

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=51b1g0kmxwc17GMcWWCq3cETwnL
Your Rationale: This color palette is filled with soft yellow, green, red to represent springtime. When one thinks of nature and garden they usually think of green. And with spring, one can imagine lovely and cheerful colors which are red and yellow. Rather than just having the colors be more saturated, I made the colors more softer to demonstrate a gentle setting of spring. 

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=33m0D0koHPM0h+Jev+ypblxR2og
Your Rationale: I choose red, yellow, and blue for my color palette for an app for kids to learn the alphabet because of the meaning behind the colors and how children interact with the colors. Children tend to go towards more bright and fun colors so that remove colors that are darker. When childern learn their abc, they sometimes feel passionate, happiness, and responsiblity learning their abcs. 

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=53v0t0kuAQolwkSarBA++LtnA++
Your Rationale: I choose a blue, and green color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity because they represnt the large responibility and the large amount of the digial world. Also because they are cool colors which gives an sense of professionalism.
