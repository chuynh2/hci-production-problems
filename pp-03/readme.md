## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://material.io/components/text-fields#anatomy
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
In sketch2, I implemented the text field by changing the previous text field from having a label above the text field to inside the field text.
Also, when the user input the text the label moves up to the top of the text field and reduce the size.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/overview
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
In sketch1, I implemented a navivation drawer with icons and labels to make navigation easier and to complement the navigation rail.
Also the active indicator is used to make have the user understand what section they are on. 
* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail/overview
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
In sketch2, I implemented a navigation rail to match the navigation drawer to have similar side bar and label for the users to understand what the icon means.
Also the active indicator is used to make have the user understand what section they are on. 
For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
